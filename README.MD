### Whitepaper

This is designed as a modular site that can add features as time goes on.  Admin through Django, connected through GraphQL API, packaged and deployed using slim secure docker containers, using serverless methodology when possible.

Eventually will connect to a shopify "third-party" site for merchandizing.
